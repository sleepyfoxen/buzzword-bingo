If
you

that
you

been
granted
travel

then
yes
.
Keep
in
mind
that
this
is
a
separate
email
from
the

email
.
If
you
have
not
received
such
email
then
that
means
that
we
have
alreadu
used
up
all
of
our
assigned
budget
for

Hi
everyone
,
I
have
an
enquiry
concerning
the
visa
application
.
There
is
a
place
in
the
application
where
i
should
but
the
name
of
the
organisation
which
have
sent
the
invitation
so
which
i
should
state
hackupc
or
the
name
of
the
university
?
Sponsors
will
explain
their
challenge
during
the
opening
ceremony
.
If
you
want
to
check
out
previous
tracks
you
can
do
so
here

Or
track
names
will

Thanks
!
Can
you
please
share
the
example
of
a
track
that
was
/
can
be
on
HackUPC
?
Can
it
be
just
“
Blockchain
”
track
which
means
we
should
build
anything
with
blockchain
to
fit
this
track
?
As
usual
we
will
have
sponsor
tracks
that
you
can
follow
.
However
the
hackathon
itself
is
not
restrictive
as
to
what
you
can
do
.
Hi
,
you
can
think
of
things
beforehand
,
but
please
be
aware
that
you
must
build
it
from
scratch
at
the
event
.
I
will
attend
HackUPC
for
the
first
time
.
Should
my
team
bring
some
ideas
and
code
with
us
or
we
must
build
something
from
scratch
based
on
tracks
you
will
have
?

Hi
guys
!
Really
looking
forward
towards
the
event
.
I
have
a
question
regarding
accommodation
:
so
we
bring
out
sleeping
matts
and
crash
in
some
hall
at
the
university
?
^^
Is
it
possible
to
arrive
a
day
earlier
or
leave
a
night
later
(
rather
than
the
two
nights
from
19th
to
21st
)
,
or
do
I
need
to
find
a
place
to
stay
for
that
one
night
(
which
is
not
a
problem
,
just
wondering
)
?
Thanks
in

Hello

I
do

I

Near
university
:
mortar_board
:
unfortunately
there
's
no
much
hostels
.
The
neighbour
is
not
much
turistic
so
it
can
be
difficult
find
what
you
want
.
Also
,
public
transport
communications
are
quite
great
.
I
recommend
you
to
find
some
hostels
near
*L3
(
green
line
)
or
L9
Sud
(
orange
line
)
*
because
it
well
be
fast
to
arrive
to
university
and
also
it
connects
with
al
city
if
you
want
to
visit
Barcelona

So

I

So
for

yourselves

Hi

I
have
a
problem
when
I
'm
trying
to
write
into
the

from
lambda
function
.
When
I
execute
the
code

my
function
,
it
seems
to
work
well
,
but
when
I
go
to
the
DB
it
's
completely
empty

Someone
have
an
idea
what
can
it
be
?
Any
idea

Hi
,
hackers
!
Today
and
tomorrow
morning
are
great
days
to
visit
Barcelona
,
if
you
've
never
been
here
before
.
In
this
document
<
https
:
//drive.google.com/file/d/1gyVpYw3JqTHr3QFg9ep6kgsW4u59CY83/view
>
you
'll
find
everything
you
need
to
know
about
visiting
the
city
,
starting
with
public
transportation
:
bus
:
:metro
:
(
If
you
do
n't
know
which
ticket
to
buy
,
just
ask
us
!
)
You
'll
also
find
a
map
of
restaurant
recommendations
:
fork_and_knife
:
by
our
team
,
if
you
'd
like
to
taste
the
local
cuisine
.
Finally
,
there
's
a
list
of
tours
of
Barcelona
,
if
you
're
not
sure
of
where
everything
is
.
They
will
take
you
to
famous
landmarks
such
as
Gaudí
's
Casa
Milà
and
Casa
Batlló
,
les
Rambles
,
Ciutadella
Park
or
Santa
Maria
del
Mar
:
church
:
.
My
personal
suggestion
is
visiting
Montjuïc
:
a
hill
overlooking
the
city
:
national_park
:
,
full
of
gardens
and
historical
buildings
:
classical_building
:
,
with
great
views
.
(
Take
the
L1
or
L3
subway
to
_Espanya_
,
and
you
'll
see
the
place
as
soon
as
you
're
in
the
street
.
If
you
'd
like
to
go
to
the
very
top
,
take
the
150
bus
from
there
and
get
down
at
the
end
of
the
line
.
)
Have
a
nice
day
and
see
you
all
tomorrow
!
:
relaxed
:
I
will
be
exploring
Barcelona
on
Friday
,
if
anyone
wants
to
join
then
hit
me
up
.
I
think
that
all
tmb
tickets
include
metro
They
do
include
the
fare
if
you
take
the
Renfe
train
(
R2
Nord
)
.
They
are
not
valid
for
the
metro
tho
.
Keep
in
mind
that
those
do
n't
include
the
fare
to/from
the
airport
(
4.60€
each
)
.
There
are
these
tickets
too
which
do
include
that
<
https
:
//www.tmb.cat/en/barcelona/fares-metro-bus/barcelona-travel-card-hola-bcn
>
Hope
it
helps
you
!
each
card
allows
you
to
take
the
two
different
kind
of
trains
we
have
+
tram
+
metro
+
bus
for
the
ones
that
want
to
visit
Barcelona
and
need
some
tips
on
the
prices
of
the
public
transport
:
These
are
the
current
cards
available
for
the
public
transport
.
To
travel
within
Barcelona
city
you
just
need
fares
of
1
zone
.

What
can
we
do
for
you
?
Hi
Biel
,
we
ll
be
back
tomorrow
morning
.
Do
you
need
help
?
Is
there
anyone
from
itequia
we
can
discuss
our
ideas
with
around
at
the
moment
?
If
that
's
the
case

Hi
Armin
!
I
'll
give
you
some
ideas
:
-
We
use
Slack
in
Itequia
,
so
an
integration
with
slack
would
be
great
!
For
example
,
the
ability
to
invite
channels
to
a
whiteboard
room
,
export
the
drawing
as
an
image
directly
to
the
channel
,
etc
.
-
If
you
are
interested
in
machine
learning
,
you
could
add
some
text/image
recognition
.
For
example
,
it
would
be
great
to
be
able
to
upload
an
image
of
something
written
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
render
it
as
text
in
the
whiteboard
.
-
If
you
are
interested
in
hardware
,
you
could
program
a
permanent
whiteboard
(
in
a
raspi
,
for
example
)
hooked
to
a
TV
or
a
projector
.
Hello
.
Out
of
curiosity
,
what
should
the
whiteboard
do
,
what
already
available
online
realtime
whiteboards
not
already
do
?
We
will
leave
out
at
3:14
.
If
u
have
some
question
come
now
.
Sure
thing
:
slightly_smiling_face
:
can
you
send
me
a
DM
with
all
yours
emails
,
please
!
Yes

But
is
it
possible

warning
:
If
you
have
created
your
DialogFlow
project
before
the
Google
Actions
one
,
you
can
use
the
DialogFlow
option
'Integrations
&
gt
;
Google
Assistant
'
to
configure
what
you
need
.
Answering
some
doubts
on
debugging
the
application
below
:
There
are
several
ways
to
check
if
your
assistant
is
working
as
expected
,
and
each
console
gives
you
different
functionalities
:
-
*Google
Actions
console*
:
Go
to
your
project
and
use
the
``
TEST
&
gt
;
Simulator
''
option
.
You
should
see
a
preview
of
how
the
application
will
be
displayed
in
your
Gooogle
Assistant
.
You
can
test
in
other
devices
using
the
ones
that
have
the
same
account
as
your
developpers
one
.
You
can
also
check
the
application
inputs/outputs
on
each
interacition
(
Request/Response
)
and
the
logs
(
View
logs
)
-
rememder
that
you
are
able
to
add
logs
into
the
JS
code-
.
-
*DialogFlow
console*
:
You
should
be
able
to
test
the
application
in
the
right
hand
side
of
the
screen
,
and
chech
the
context
values
or
the
intents
and
entities
detected
.
In
'Diagnosis
info
'
you
should
be
able
to
check
more
information
for
each
interaction
.
Later
on
,
if
you
want
to
share
your
bot
to
others
,
you
can
use
the
option
'Integrations
&
gt
;
Web
demo
''
,
enable
this
and
share
the
URL
to
anybody
.
Hope
this
information
is
useful
!

given
to
pool
of

can
form
a

and
solve
it
in
a

a
sort
of

Good
Morning

hi
all
Hi
<
@
UDHL3QHUN
>
,
the
dataset
included
in
the
github
is
just
a
sample
to
create
a
model
.
You
can
use
that
or
create
your
own
.
It
will
be
very
difficult
to
create
a
NLP
model
that
is
able
to
understand
what
is
fake
and
what
is
not
,
you
should
use
an
NLP
model
to
understand
what
are
the
news
about
in
order
to
check
if
those
facts
are
correct
,
as
<
@
UCKUJ8KNZ
>
pointed
out
If
you
want
to
make
an
ML
model
,
you
might
find
this
dataset
interesting
:
<
https
:
//www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news
>
I
might
be
wrong
,
but
I
don
’
t
think
that
the
ML
model
is
what
this
challenge
is
looking
for
,
but
more
of
the
integration
of
the
NLP
model
already
provided
in
a
plugin
.
Hi
,
the
dataset
in
the
github
has
only
labels
for
news
categories
but
not
for
fake
data
.
Is
there
any
dataset
for
fake
data
which
we
can
use
or
should
we
just
search
in
the
internet
for
it
?
By
the
way
,
remember
the
winners
will
get
a
Goole
Home
for
each
of
the
team
's
members
!

find
some
more
info
and
a
base
project
with
a
scrapper
and
connection
to
Google
Cloud
NLP
in
this
github
.
Feel
free
to
start
with
that

they

the

price
overall
dont
think

Will
Bloomberg
provide
some
data
?
Hey
Mihnea

Sorry
,
we
packed
up

We
'll

Hey
guys
,
is
there
a
Bloomberg
stand
?
We
ca
n't
seem
to
find
it
Hi
guys
,
we
'll
be
in
our
stand
until
9pm
,
if
you
have
any
questions
come
and
let
us
know
!
Find
attached
the
details
of
each
column
an
then
to
1110000
which
is
a
2km
increase
it
jumps
from
1077000
to
1108000
which
is
31km
increase
But
the
increments
are
not
in
1000mts
steps
Hi
!
Again
!
About
another
question
we
had
,
``
what
's
happening
with
the
milage
''
-
this
datum
is
obtained
directly
from
the
cars
,
which
are
only
``
sharing
''
their
info
with
a
1Km
sensitivity
.
This
is
why
the
increments
are
in
1000mts
steps
.
thank
you
!
This
is
a
really
interesting
tool
that
can
help
you
enlarge
your
data
set
:

Take
a
look
at
it

if
you

know

Hi
<
@
UCKH43NJC

yes
,
the
Infojobs
API
lets
you
to
filter
by
keyword
or
category
.
Here
you
have
the
documentation
about
it
:

I
'm
sorry
for
the
late
question
,
does
InfoJobs
API
have
a
possibility
to
filter
offers
by
keywords
or
categories
?
That
is
correct
.
the
thing
is
that
this
needs
to
be
automated
for
many
different
JSON
queries
of
random
lengths
and
properties
.
And
even
like
these
I
ca
n't
print
the
values
``
`
const
dataJson
=
JSON.parse
(
data
)
;
const
result
=
{
firstLocation
:
dataJson.Places
[
0
]
,
secondLocation
:
dataJson.Places
[
1
]
,
carriers
:
dataJson.Carriers
}
;
``
`
Anyone
who
knows
how
to
setup
rethinkdb
with
AWS
(
or
without
)
?
so
it
should
look
like
:
``
`
{
firstLocation
:
{
}
,
secondLocation
:
{
}
,
carriers
:
[
]
}
``
`
?
I
want
to
search
flights
and
their
prices
from
locationA
to
locationB
between
two
dates
.
This
is
alist
of
carriers
,
yes
.
I
would
like
to
have
one
array
with
the
carriers
,
two
objects
for
the
locations
what
do
you
want
to
achieve
with
this
data
?
Looks
like
a
list
of
all
carriers
that
offer
flights
from
or
to
the
first
location
from
or
to
the
second
location
right
?
Is
there
someone
who
know
how
to
record/convert
linear16
,
mono
wav
sound
in

(
JavaScript
)
?
Sure
,
thanks
!
If
you
are
at

I
can
come
to
wherever
you

can
you
send
me
the
object
?
maybe
i
can

Hey
Patrick
!
The
thing
is
that
JSON.parse

was
reading
the
reduce
documentation
and
while
I
get
what
it
does
,
I
do
n't
really
see
how
it
would
help
me
to
get
all
the
data
from
the
String
to
arrays
Is
there
someone
who
knows
how
to

In
IoT
,
small
devices
need
Wireless
Internet
connection
and
sometimes
also
are
battery
powered
.
WiFi
or
Bluetooth
can
be
good
for
low
distance
but
for
Wide
Area
are
not
adequate
.
Mobile
Network
is
good
but
is
expensive
and
consume
is
not
as
low
as
desired
.
In
this
cases
,
the
LoraWAN
technology
could
be
a
great
solution
,
based
in
a
license
less
frequency
like
WiFi
or
Bluetooth
can
be
operated
by
anyone
,
also
give
an
excellent
distance
coverage
and
very
low
power
requirements
.
Based
on
this
technology
a
worldwide
Internet
of
Things
enthusiasts
had
developed
The
Thing
Network
that
is
establishing
a
global
open
source
and
free
LoraWAN
Network
.
If
anyone
during
the
HackUPC

likes
to
test
it
or
even
use
it
in
any
challenge
you
will
have
the
opportunity
to

devices
from

Hi
everyone
!
I
'm
a
second
year
computer
science
student
at
the
University
of
Edinburgh
and
I
'm
looking
for
people
I
could
team
up
with
.
I
am
mostly
comfortable
with
C
#
,
Python
and
Java
,
though
during
my
short
``
career
''
I
was
also
exposed
to
web
and
mobile
development
.
I
can
quickly
adapt
to
new
situations
and
apply
my
current
skills
.
I
know
some
of
the
basics
of
machine
learning
as
I
took
a
course
on
coursera
a
while
back
and
some
hobby
projects
,
though
I
have
never
really
gotten
into
it
and
would
love
to
get
experience
in
the
field
.
This
summer
I
also
worked
on
some
basic
cryptography
projects
at
work
.
I
have
participated
in
hackathons
before
,
yet
I
always
teamed
up
with
my
friends
,
so
this
time
I
want
to
pair
up
with
people
I
do
n't
know
because
it
seems
exciting
and
new
.
I
will
put
all
my
effort
into
the
project
and
I
hope
to
learn
a
great
bunch
of
stuff
while
having
lots
of
fun
!
Who
’
s
still
looking
for
a
team
with
an
interesting
skillset
and
the
love
of
finishing
a
brilliant
project
?
Any
machine
learning
folks
,
AR/VR
,
mobile
?
We
can
definitely
meet
and
discuss
.

If
you
're
still
looking
,
I
've
got
tensorflow
experience
,
and
I
've
done
quite
a
few
hackathons
(
15+
,
prizes
at
most
of
them
)
.
I
do
most
of
my
work
in
Node.js
,
though
I
'm
working
on
adding
Go
and
Rust
to
my
primary
languages

Full

which
is
what
I

company
for
over
a

Hi
everyone
!
I
'm
a
CS
Student
at
URV
on
my
4th
and
last
year
.
I
'm
a
junior
web
developer
,
though
mobile
development
has
always
rang
a
bell

I
know
the
basics
of
C
,
Java

Python
from
university
assignments
,
JavaScript
and
Php
from
work
and
Kotlin
from
side-projects

The
language
I
'm
most
comfortable
with
is
definitely
Java

attend
to
the
Hackathon
alone

Hello
!
This
year
’
s
HackUPC
hackathon
will
be
my
first
one
and
I
’
m
really
excited
about
it
.
I
’
m
beginner
in
programmer
.
I
spend
most
of
my
free
time
with
Swift
building
iOS
apps
and
this
is
also
the
language
that
I
’
m
the
most
comfortable
with
.
I
know
little
python
,
javascript
,
html
and
framework
for
js
-
ReactNative
.
If
your
team
has
a
room
for
another
hacker
-
message
me
!
Also
I
think
I
should
mention
is
that
I
’
m
fourteen
,
but
I
learn
fast
and
really
want
‘
level
up
’
in
my
programming
skills
.

Hey
guys
,
I
'm
a
computer
science
student
.
I
'm
interested
in
machine
learning
and
had
some
experience
with
it
.
I
've
also
done
backend
(
php/java
)
and
android
development
.
It
would
be
really
interesting
to
work
on
a
project
involving
hardware
but
have
really
little
experience
with
it
,
learning
is
the
goal
!
So
if
any
team
is
interested
message
me
!
Looking
forward
for
the

We
are
a
students
from
last

3rd
year
of
Computer
Science
in
Universitat
Autónoma
de
Barcelona
.
This
is
our
first
Hackathon
and
we
are
excited
!
We
are
experienced
in
Java
,
C
#
+
WPF
,
basic
knowledgement
(
and
a
little
more
)
in
Python
,
PHP
,
Android
,
Web
Services
,
...
In
fact
,
our
profile
is
more
as
Backend
Developers
,
but
we
can
code
in
other
languages
and
we
learn
fast
!
We
are
looking
for
a
team
or
to
create
a
new
one
.
We
expect
to
create
something
powerful
and
useful
with
your
help
.
Also
,
we
want
to
meet
cool
people
and
have
a
good
weekend
.
Please
,
feel
free
to
DM
to
talk

We

looking

Plans
for
HackUPC
:
We
'd
like
to
use
Node.js
(
.ts
)
,
MongoDB
in
the
backend
and
React
(
Native
)
in
the
frontend
.
Eventually
some
Machine
Learning
with
tenserflow.js
or
another
library
.
With
that
stack
we
plan
to
find
a
challenging
but
doable
challenge
and
create
a
mobile
or
web
application
.
In
front-
and
backend
we
are
pretty
experienced
,
but
just
know
the
basics
of
ML
(
tenserflow.js
)
.
Looking
for
:
People
with
similar
interests
who
'd
give
a
good
addition
to
the
team
,
by
knowing
some
of
the
above
mentionen
stack
and/or
can
add
useful
skills
(
Design
,
ML
,
Hosting
...
)
.

if
interested
in
joining
us

Hello
people
!
We
are
two
hardware
hacking
guys
searching
for
some
people
!
We
have
several
ideas
yet
,
and
we
need
people
interested
in
developing
some
of
them
.
Mostly
with
circuit
soldering
and
oscilloscopes
and
stuff
.
Moreover
,
we
will
probably
need
some
Android
developer
,
better
with
knowledge
of
Bluetooth
protocol
on
Android
!
If
anyone
is
interested
,
answer
here
or

We

before

like
Google
Hashcode
,
SWERC
and
also
a
CTF
but
this
will
be
our
ever
first
hackathon
and
we
are
exited
about
it
!
:

:
We
can
code
in
C
,
Java

Python

we
still
do
n't
know
what
we
are
going
to
do
but
we
are
not
afraid
of
going
deeper
in
any
area
&

What
we
want
to
do
is
meet
cool
people
and
learn
a
lot
about
different
stuff
.
So
,
if
you
have
room
for
two
hackathon-newbies
or
you
find
yourself
in
the
same
situation
as
us
,
just
DM
us

we
will
have
a

*Motivation*
I
had
my
first
Hackathon
2
years
ago
,
and
frankly
did
n't
accomplish
anything
because
I
could
barely
code
back
then
.
:
stuck_out_tongue
:
I
always
wanted
to
take
on
the
challenges
again
and
try
building
something
cool
with
awesome
people
at
events
like
a
Hackathon
,
so
here
I
am
!
*Interest
Topics
&
amp
;
Learning*
ML
and
DL
,
but
also
generic
apps
where
I
can
practice
and
learn
more
about
software
development
.
Would
be
great
if
someone
has
come
up
with
an
idea
using
in-browser
TensorFlow.js
,
maybe
NLP
related
because
most
people
are
working
on
computer
vision
related
stuff
.
I
'm
still
kind
of
at
an
early
stage
with
ML
or
DL
,
so
maybe
I
wo
n't
be
very
helpful
when
it
comes
to
training
models
.
But
if
your
idea/app
needs
a
``
shell
''
,
_whether
it
's
about
AI
or
not_
,
I
could
definitely
help
package
it
up
for
end
users
,
be
it
an
app
or
a
website
!
Every
time
I
see
low
FPS
stuff
I
got
ta
check
my
CPU
usage
:
joy
:
I
'm
glad
it
's
just
a
gif
this
time
That
sounds
great

Ideally
I
would
really
like
to
deliver
some
working
piece
of
software
in
the
end
(
at
least
partially
)
.
I
do
n't
mind
sharing
a
team
,
but
at
this
point
I
'm
not
100
%
sure
,
got
ta
explore
more
ideas
and
see
.

There
's
no
codes
.
I
know
that
in
HackUPC
Live
is
saying
things
that
are
n't
true
but
there
was
a
misunderstanding
.
If
you
want
to
get
a
code
,
you
have
to
click
to
go.tech/hackupc18
Hey
,
where
is
the
table
to
get
the
codes
?
Hi
hackers
!
We
've
been
talking
with
.tech
and
they
told
us
that
you
will
receive
your
domain
as
soon
as
they
reviewed
them
.
Sorry
for
the
delay
but
we
can
not
do
more
from
our
side
:
disappointed
:
Sorry
again
.
Same
:

Same
,
and
still
no

from

...
We
have
n't
get
the
domain
code
yet
...
Will
it
take
any
longer
?
Ok
,
never
mind
,
it
started
working
the
same
moment
I
posted
the
previous
message
)
We
successfully
got
a
domain
and
set
up
A
record
to
an
instance
on
Amazon
.
But
I
get
DSNERROR
when
I
try
to
access
the
domain
.
I
guess
it
just
takes
time
for
DNS
records
to
get
updated
?
How
long
can
it
take
?
We
applied
around
22
hours
yesterday
I
’
ve
emailed
them
last
night
,
but
haven
’
t
heard
back
yet

Some
tips
that
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
:
1
.
Scopes
are
case
sensitive
and
must
be
in
upper
case
.
2
.
For
`
Post
`
/
`
Put
`
operations
you
must
send
the
`
content-type
`
header
.
3
.
To
obtain
an
access
token
you
must
perform
a
post
to
this
url
:
`
<
https
:
//www.infojobs.net/oauth/authorize
?
grant_type=authorization_code
&
amp
;
client_id=XXXX
&
amp
;
client_secret=XXXX
&
amp
;
code=VERIFICATION_CODE
&
amp
;
redirect_uri=http
:
//www.SOME-URL.com
>
`
The
parameters
are
query
params
and
they
must
not
be
send
as
request
body
.
just
modified
``
company
''
I
'm
going
to
analyze
your
request
.
Could
you
send
me
your
api
client
for
DM
?

Hi

I

with
alex
could
you
send
me
by

the
value
of
the
Authorization
header
?
What
am
I
missing
here

The
access
token
is
only
valid
for
the
scopes
provided
in
the

request
:
``

Hope
this
information
helps
you
.
This
is
an
example
for
the
<
https
:
//developer.infojobs.net/documentation/operation/curriculum-list-2.xhtml
>
operation
.
If
you
want
to
get
the
access
token
for
several
API
operations
,
you
can
provide
a
comma
separated
list
of
scopes
.
Yes
,
for
each
operation
in
the
documentation
you
have
information
about
what
is
the
scope
for
that
operation
.
Below
you
can
see
an
example
:
this
names
are
on
the
api
documentation
on
each
``

''
List
of
SCOPE_NAMES
like

Hi
Hi
there
,
Sergi
here
,
if
you
want
,
I
’
m
the
booth
and
I
can
give
you
live
support
to
your
questions
It
's
my
turn
now
,
so
stop
asking
Oscar
,
and
ask
your
questions
to
me
instead
.
Hi
!
I
'm
Javier
from
Infojobs
.
If
you
need
any
help
with
the
InfoJobs
API
just
ask
me
in
this
channel
!
Hi
hackers
!
I
am
Oscar
from
Infojobs
!
ask
away
any
doubts
regarding
integration
with
our
site
and
good
luck
to
you
all
!
mmm
that
's
why
we
are
using
passport
,
will
try
to
make
a
workarround
So
for
that
you
need
to
send
the
request
to
a
browser
because
that
needs
user
interaction
.
Your
application
is
going
to
do
an
action
in
behalf
of
a
user
so
the
user
must
logged
in
InfoJobs
and
authorize
your
client
to
execute
requests
in
his
name
.
yep
,
this
is
our
problem
,
showing
the
login
and
authorization
page
.
Maybe
your
problem
is
trying
to
get
the
login
and
authorization
page
?
There
are
2
steps
for
OAuth2
authentication
:
1
.
Get
a
verification
code
,
for
that
you
need
user
iteraction
,
so
you
will
need
to
seend
to
a
browser
,
webview
or
similar
calling
the
url
:
``
`
<
https
:
//www.infojobs.net/api/oauth/user-authorize/index.xhtml
>
?
scope=COMMA_SEPARATED_LIST_OF_SCOPE_NAMES
&
amp
;
client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
&
amp
;
redirect_uri=YOUR_CALLBACK_URI
&
amp
;
response_type=code
&
amp
;
state=OPTIONAL_CLIENT_LOCAL_STATE
``
`
With
this
request
you
will
see
the
login
and
authorization
page
of
infojobs
.
Once
you
have
the
verification
code
.
You
must
do
the
step
2
.
2
.
Do
a
`
POST
`
request
to
`
<
https
:
//www.infojobs.net/oauth/authorize
>
`
using
the
following
parameters
and
the
verification
code
get
in
the
first
step
:
``
`
grant_type=authorization_code
client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
(
URL
Encoded
if
necessary
)
code=VERIFICATION_CODE_AQUIRED_IN_STEP_1
redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
``
`
and
here
you
obtain
the
access
token
.
Check
if
you
have
done
both
steps
.
ok
,
let
me
check
.
Give
me
one
min
also
,
the
authURL
is
the
next
:
const
authURL
=
``
<
https
:
//www.infojobs.net/api/oauth/user-authorize/index.xhtml
?
scope=CV
&
amp
;
response_type=code
>
''
;
the
infojobs
screen
is
not
shown
when
we
call
the
route
to
perform
the
login
action
our
problem
:
This
is
our
passport
call
passport.use
(
new
OAuth2Strategy

hi

Hi
!
Borja
from
Infojobs
here
.
If
you
need
any
help
with
the
InfoJobs
API
just
ask
me
in
this
channel
!
You
can
use
this
URL
`
<
http
:
//www.infojobs.net/core/oauth2vc/index.xhtml
>
`
you
need
to
put
a
public
URL
,
in
the
documentation
specifies
next
:
:
eyes
:
In
the
second
case
you
can
get
the
access_tocken
doing
the
http
requests
as
the
documentation
specifies
.
and
for
ROLE_CANDIDATE
API
calls
you
need
to
follow
the
instructions
in
<
https
:
//developer.infojobs.net/documentation/user-oauth2/index.xhtml
>
You
do
n't
need
oauth2
.
For
PUBLIC
API
calls
you
only
need
basic
authentication
<
https
:
//developer.infojobs.net/documentation/app-auth/index.xhtml
>
Is
there
an
easy
way
to
get
infojobs
data
from
node
?
I
'm
trying
with
basic
authentication
but
pretty
sure
i
need
Oauth2
